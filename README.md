# Embedded

The `embedded` repository contains small embedded C projects. These projects are developed  using the Visual Studio Code IDE in macOS Big Sur (11.7). Two development boards are used, the [SDP-K1](projects/sdp-k1/README.md) or the nrf52840-dongle.

## SDP-K1 Projects Overview

### LED Blink

Initial project to get familiarized with set the SDP-K1 development platform (STM32F469NIH6 based), STM32CubeMX and the VS Code set up and toolchain for embedded C development.

### ECG

This project uses the [EVAL-AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD4130-8.html), which hosts the AD4130, an Ultra Low Power 24-Bit Sigma-Delta ADC with integrated PGA and FIFO. This ADC will be used to acquire a lead I ECG using wet electrodes.
